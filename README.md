## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> “Don’t just learn algorithms — learn **why**, **when**, and **how** to use them.”

Each topic includes:
- Concept explanation (simple + deep)
- Mathematical intuition
- Python implementation from scratch (where useful)
- Library-based implementation (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Practical examples & mini-projects
